🩺 Symptom-Based Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project is a machine learning-based application designed to predict possible diseases based on user-input symptoms. The goal is to assist users in obtaining preliminary insights into potential health issues, empowering them to seek timely medical attention.

💡 Overview
Health issues often start with mild symptoms, and early detection can play a critical role in treatment. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict likely diseases based on symptoms provided by the user.

The system is trained on a comprehensive dataset of diseases and their associated symptoms and provides real-time disease predictions through a user-friendly web interface.

🔍 Features
✅ Input symptoms through a web form

🧠 Predicts possible diseases using trained ML models

📊 Multiple algorithm support (KNN, Navie Bayes, SVC)

💻 Interactive frontend with dynamic prediction updates

📁 Dataset-based learning for better accuracy

🧾 Model comparison , accuracy reports , with related precautions and doctor recommendation 

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or use Streamlit/Flask templates)

Backend: Python, Flask

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

Visualization: Matplotlib / Seaborn (for reports)

📂 Dataset
The model uses a dataset containing symptoms and disease labels. You can find the dataset here:
